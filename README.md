# P5JS-Using-A-Media-File
This program demonstrates uploading media files in JavaScript using the functions "loadimage" and "image". Due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, "loadImage" is called in the "preload" function before "setup" is called. "Preload" is used to load media assets so that they are ready to use in "setup" and the rest of the program!
